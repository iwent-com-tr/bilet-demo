# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Web Push notifications for the iWent PWA to notify users about important event changes. The system will send push notifications to all devices of users who hold valid tickets when an event's time changes or when new events are added. The implementation follows the VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) protocol and includes a complete backend infrastructure with Redis queuing for scalable fan-out notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ticket holder, I want to receive push notifications on my PWA when an event I have tickets for changes its time, so that I don't miss the updated schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event's start time is modified THEN the system SHALL send push notifications to all users who have valid tickets for that event
2. WHEN a user has multiple devices with the PWA installed THEN the system SHALL send notifications to all registered devices
3. WHEN a push notification is received THEN the notification SHALL display the event title, change details, and provide an action to view the event
4. IF a user's push subscription becomes invalid (404/410 error) THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the subscription from the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive push notifications when new events are added to the platform, so that I can discover and book tickets for interesting events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new event is published THEN the system SHALL send push notifications to all users who have enabled new event notifications
2. WHEN a new event notification is sent THEN it SHALL include the event title, brief description, and a link to view event details
3. WHEN multiple new events are added quickly THEN the system SHALL use topic-based message collapsing to avoid notification spam

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to grant or deny push notification permissions through the PWA interface, so that I can control my notification preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the PWA THEN the system SHALL request push notification permission through a user-initiated action
2. WHEN a user grants permission THEN the system SHALL register their device subscription with their user account
3. WHEN a user denies permission THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the denial without breaking functionality
4. WHEN a user wants to disable notifications THEN the system SHALL provide a way to unsubscribe and mark their subscription as disabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the notification system to handle high volumes of notifications efficiently, so that the system remains performant during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending notifications to many users THEN the system SHALL use a background job queue with Redis for processing
2. WHEN processing notification jobs THEN the system SHALL limit concurrency to prevent overwhelming external push services
3. WHEN push services return rate limiting errors (429) THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
4. WHEN notification payloads exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL trim content or use identifiers with client-side resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for the push notification system, so that I can maintain system reliability and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN push subscriptions fail with 404 or 410 errors THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up invalid subscriptions
2. WHEN notification sending fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including job ID, event ID, and failure reasons
3. WHEN the system processes notification jobs THEN it SHALL track metrics for sent, failed, and total notifications
4. IF the Redis queue becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully and provide appropriate error responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the push notification system to protect my data and follow security best practices, so that my information remains safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing VAPID keys THEN the system SHALL keep private keys server-side only and never expose them to clients
2. WHEN handling push subscriptions THEN the system SHALL tie each subscription to an authenticated user account
3. WHEN sending notification payloads THEN the system SHALL avoid including personally identifiable information
4. WHEN exposing notification endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication, rate limiting, and CSRF protection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and browsers, I want push notifications to work consistently across my supported platforms, so that I receive notifications regardless of my device choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome, Edge, or Firefox on desktop or Android THEN the system SHALL support full push notification functionality
2. WHEN using iOS Safari with PWA installed to Home Screen (iOS 16.4+) THEN the system SHALL support push notifications
3. WHEN the browser doesn't support push notifications THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking other functionality
4. WHEN notifications include action buttons THEN the system SHALL handle browser-specific quirks and provide fallback behavior
