# Event Chat Group Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the event chat system to implement automatic chat group creation with proper admin roles for organizers and automatic user addition when purchasing tickets.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Chat Group Creation**
- **When an event is created**: A chat group is automatically established
- **Organizer becomes admin**: Event organizer is automatically assigned as the chat group administrator
- **Enhanced logging**: Clear console messages indicate when chat groups are created

### 2. **Automatic User Addition to Chat Groups**
- **On ticket purchase**: Users are automatically added to the event's chat group
- **Enhanced notifications**: Users receive welcome messages when joining chat groups
- **Better error handling**: Proper logging when auto-join fails

### 3. **Event Publication Chat Activation**
- **When event is published**: Chat group becomes fully active
- **Admin confirmation**: Organizer receives notification that chat is ready for users
- **User notifications**: Existing members are notified when event goes live

### 4. **Enhanced Chat Group Management**

#### New API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/chat/event/:eventId/info` - Get chat group information

#### Enhanced Participant Information:

- **Member count**: Total and online member counts
- **Recent activity**: Shows recent message activity

#### Improved Access Control:
- **Organizer privileges**: Clear admin status for event organizers

```

#### 2. Enhanced Chat Service (`src/backendN/src/modules/chat/chat.service.ts`)
```typescript
// New methods:

- Enhanced getEventParticipants() // Shows admin status and member count
```

#### 3. Enhanced Ticket Service (`src/backendN/src/modules/tickets/ticket.service.ts`)
- Better logging for automatic chat group joining
- Enhanced error handling for chat group operations

#### 4. Enhanced Event Service (`src/backendN/src/modules/event/event.service.ts`)

#### 5. New Chat Controller Method (`src/backendN/src/modules/chat/chat.controller.ts`)
```typescript
export const getEventChatGroupInfo = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Returns comprehensive chat group information
}
```

#### 6. New Chat Route (`src/backendN/src/modules/chat/chat.routes.ts`)
```typescript
router.get('/event/:eventId/info', authGuard.required, chatController.getEventChatGroupInfo);
```

## Socket.IO Events

### New Events Emitted:
1. **`chat:ready`** - Sent to organizer when event chat group is created
2. **`chat:joined`** - Enhanced with role information when users join
3. **`chat:admin_joined`** - Sent to organizer when they join as admin
4. **`chat:event_published`** - Sent when event is published and chat becomes active

### Enhanced Event Data:
```javascript
// chat:joined event now includes:
{
  eventId: "event-123",
  eventName: "Summer Music Festival",
  eventSlug: "summer-music-festival",
  role: "member", // or "admin"
  message: "Welcome to Summer Music Festival chat group!"
}

// chat:admin_joined event:
{
  eventId: "event-123",
  eventName: "Summer Music Festival",
  role: "admin",
  message: "You are now admin of Summer Music Festival chat group"
}
```
